# datawarehouse-MT
This is a data warehouse where we build and collect a database about yearly performance in a small business of a higher education institute.
Inside of an ETL process, which is extraction, transformation, and loading, we need to get all the possible knowledge and information previously to build Machine Learning Models. 
It's important to build the infrastructure to extract the data, how to process, transform, and where to store that raw information.

So in this case we've built this data warehouse which is developed in Postgress, and the process of extraction and transform was done in Pentaho PDI.
